# Intermediate Machine Learning
This course is estimated to last 4 hours, builds on Python, and prepares for the following courses:
- [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)
- [Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series)

A `requirements.txt` file is included. It lists all the required dependencies to run the coding exercises present in this course. To install it, please execute: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## [Lesson 1: Introduction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/introduction)
This course will go trough more realistic usecases than the [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/jmtc7/kaggle-courses/tree/main/00_intro_to_machine_learning) one, with topics including:
- Handling of real world data, with missing values and categorical variables
- Designing pipelines to improve ML models
- Advanced validation methods (cross-validation)
- Build and use state-of-the-art ML models (XGBoost)
- Avoiding common ML issues (leakage)

There will be some coding exercises, which will use the data from [Kaggle's Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course). The predictions will be submitted to see how we rise in the leaderboard as we improve our model.

An example script refreshing how to read data, build a random forest, train it, and generate predictions will be available in the [ML review script](https://github.com/jmtc7/kaggle-courses/tree/main/01_intermediate_machine_learning/coding_exercises/lesson00__ml_intro_review.py). It generates the `00predictions.csv`, which can be used to submit predictions to the [Kaggle's Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course). It gives a public score of 20998.8378.
