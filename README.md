## Kaggle Courses
Kaggle proposes several courses, from the basics of Python programming to [Machine](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) and [Deep Learning]() concepts, passing by more specific topics such as [databases](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql), [Computer Vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision), [time series](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series), [geospatial data](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis), and [explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability), amongst many others.
